Ntropy Network,"Large language models have brought about a paradigm shift to the way we think about the world. The potential of bringing human-level reasoning abilities to silicon is almost limitless. However, large scale enterprise adoption is still to happen. While significantly more efficient than humans for many tasks, the cost and latency of using LLMs at scale is still prohibitive by many orders of magnitude. At Ntropy, our mission is to bring reasoning capabilities of the largest models into real world applications. This requires a fundamentally different approach to almost all parts of the model stack, including prompting, fine-tuning, monitoring, caching and deployment. For maximum performance, these need to be optimized for each task. We have developed a new kind of domain-specific wrappers for language models, that leads to 4-6 orders of magnitude improvement in average entropy per token. The secret is breaking down complex problems into manageable segments, leveraging cached past responses to formulate answers to new queries. The first domain we have been building for is finance. In early 2022, we released the first set of tools for extracting information from bank transactions. This challenge has traditionally demanded human expertise—accountants, underwriters, financial controllers, which restricted applications to only the most substantial transactions and left areas like small business lending and instant consumer credit scoring out of reach. Using the Ntropy API, financial data can now be processed with super-human accuracy, scaling to cover over 4 billion daily electronic transactions globally. The result is a more equitable and efficient financial system for everyone. In the near future, we will take what we have built for financial data to other domains, enabling anyone, from single developers to Fortune 500 companies, to run large language models at maximum effectiveness to solve the hardest and most impactful problems in the world. We are just at the beginning of our journey and you will be one of the early members of the team to shape this future with us. We - come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts. are allergic to over-engineering. are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo. love playing board and video games. are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it. have a sense of humor (well, we think we do). As an early member of our backend engineering team, you will help - push the limits of distributed computing and orchestrating large-scale machine learning pipelines. - build the team and drive the direction of the company. - shape our product and culture. - experience the real-world impact of what you build.
