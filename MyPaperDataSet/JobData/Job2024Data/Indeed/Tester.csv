You’ll get a short intro call right after the puzzle. This is the best place to raise any questions you might have. Thanks …the ivision Assessment Team. What’s the job?

Probing: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing. Extending: Now that you’ve found a weakness… how far can you extend your access into the system?
