The process starts with a technical puzzle that should take around an hour and will give you an idea of exactly what we mean by software deconstruction. Got questions? You’ll get a short intro call right after the puzzle. This is the best place to raise any questions you might have. Thanks …the ivision Assessment Team. What’s the job? You will work on information security projects for our clients. We test security of software and hardware systems. Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them. Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements. This is a full-time job working for the ivision Assessment Team (https://research.ivision.com). We are titled as “consultants” but the position being offered is a traditional permanent hire. What would you do? Every two to three weeks you’ll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve: Recon: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device. Probing: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing. Extending: Now that you’ve found a weakness… how far can you extend your access into the system? Writing: Now that you’ve hacked your way in you’ll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it. If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you’ll find this job very enjoyable. Who are we looking for? You do not need to have information security experience. If you’ve got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec. People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level. This is not a “travel every week” type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely. We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans. Skills & Requirements Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you’ve invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.

The Live Collections Agent will keep these endpoints up to date based on new observed traffic. API discovery is just the beginning of what we hope to offer. Coming soon: the ability to explore automatically updated API endpoints based on error, latency, and volume. In the next months, we’re planning to work with our early users to figure out how to surface this information in the most helpful ways. Who Are We?

The ideal candidate is creative and driven, passionate about technology, able to learn quickly, and willing to help others to develop their skills. Minimum Requirements: US citizenship. Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field (or related experience in lieu of degree). 8 years of experience.

Project/Stack/Packages: Working within a ~3yr old, 1k+ component, complex production Vue app which sits on 4-5 enclaves. Vue2, VUEX, Vuetify, Cesium, Vis, Cypress. Very few of our developers work on multiple projects - unless they want to. If you prefer being focused on one project, you can. Spin up time with the code and app may take some time. The app is complex and the mission it serves is truly ground/space breaking. Some of the problems we’re trying to solve have simply not been solved yet.

Desire to collaborate & share ideas in a respectful and productive manner - especially during planning and TEMs where there may not be an agreed upon single best/better way to do something. Prioritize other’s code over your own (when possible). At any given time, the number of people who contribute to the UI is between 5-15 with varying levels of experiences and skills. We also house many interns at various points of the year who require more feedback and guidance from the intermediate and senior developers. Possess ability and desire to take a task/idea through all phases of design and implementation. Performant code. The amount of data being sent, processed, and received in the app is very large.

Possible Future Big Rocks/Work: Potentially prep and migrate from VUEX to Pinia (or something similar). Potentially prep and migrate from Vue2 to Vue3.

Ntropy Network,Frontend engineer,"San Francisco, CA","Large language models have brought about a paradigm shift to the way we think about the world. The potential of bringing human-level reasoning abilities to silicon is almost limitless. However, large scale enterprise adoption is still to happen. While significantly more efficient than humans for many tasks, the cost and latency of using LLMs at scale is still prohibitive by many orders of magnitude. At Ntropy, our mission is to bring reasoning capabilities of the largest models into real world applications. This requires a fundamentally different approach to almost all parts of the model stack, including prompting, fine-tuning, monitoring, caching and deployment. For maximum performance, these need to be optimized for each task. We have developed a new kind of domain-specific wrappers for language models, that leads to 4-6 orders of magnitude improvement in average entropy per token. The secret is breaking down complex problems into manageable segments, leveraging cached past responses to formulate answers to new queries. The first domain we have been building for is finance. In early 2022, we released the first set of tools for extracting information from bank transactions. This challenge has traditionally demanded human expertise—accountants, underwriters, financial controllers, which restricted applications to only the most substantial transactions and left areas like small business lending and instant consumer credit scoring out of reach. Using the Ntropy API, financial data can now be processed with super-human accuracy, scaling to cover over 4 billion daily electronic transactions globally. The result is a more equitable and efficient financial system for everyone. In the near future, we will take what we have built for financial data to other domains, enabling anyone, from single developers to Fortune 500 companies, to run large language models at maximum effectiveness to solve the hardest and most impactful problems in the world. We are just at the beginning of our journey and you will be one of the early members of the team to shape this future with us.
