National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre,"Chi tiết công việc Intern - Partnerships Development tại National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre Team Information The Partnerships Development team is part of the Corporate & Industry Partnerships department. Our team focuses on engaging with Champions of Good organisations to contribute to the Company of Good ecosystem to drive the adoption of Corporate Purpose. This is achieved via strategic partnership projects, events such as Learning Journeys, C-suite engagements, thought leadership engagement and media features, as well as supporting industry-level conversations. Through these initiatives, the team hopes to strengthen the corporate purpose ecosystem and increase the number of companies engaged in collaborations. Projects NVPC x Unilever Purpose for Growth Programme Phase 2 NVPC and Unilever has an ongoing strategic partnership to support small and medium-sized (SME) companies in Singapore to embark on their Corporate Purpose journey which will help them align to emerging trends in sustainability and ESG (environment, social and governance) while positioning them for future growth. The core programme design will be a long-term capability programme that comprises of two phases: Phase 1: An information session where SMEs are invited to understand, and be inspired to adopt corporate purpose in order to do good in Singapore; and Phase 2: A smaller group of committed SMEs can embark on a deeper journey with Unilever to adopt corporate purpose through structured learning and mentorship – ultimately, supporting their long-term and sustainable business growth. Phase 2 of the partnership comprises a series of 4 deep-dive learning and mentorship sessions commencing from September 2023 over 16 weeks. Each session will have a duration of 3 to 4 hours, including content learning and hands-on group activities with the Unilever mentor and NVPC facilitator. There will also be a programme “graduation” for participating SMEs at the Company of Good Summit 2024. The intern will support the PD team in areas including session organising and setup, content planning and facilitation, liaison with participating SMEs on attendance and queries, providing reports on the programme to internal and external stakeholders, conducting post-programme review/assessment and assisting on the logistics for the graduation. Accounts Management The Partnerships Development team manages 60 key Champions of Good company accounts. The team oversees relationship building and communications with the points-of-contact at each company, and provides timely updates on upcoming programmes and events that these companies may want to participate in (e.g. SG Cares Giving Week, Company of Good 2023 application).

We’re building the state-of-the-art in machine learning, with an experienced team from FAANG/AI research and top startups, and are backed by top global investors such as Y Combinator.

To create relevant and industry-defining work. Whether it’s to better align on the brand’s business challenges, understand the people they need to reach, tell the stories they’ve always wanted to tell or to identify the best direction to get there – when brands work with us, they get a team who knows that if we don’t rethink everything, we change nothing.

Next generation of consumers. Next generation of platforms. Next generation of content. Next generation of brands. That’s what gets us up every day. Working with brands to be at the forefront of the next generation. To create relevant and industry-defining work. Whether it’s to better align on the brand’s business challenges, understand the people they need to reach, tell the stories they’ve always wanted to tell or to identify the best direction to get there – when brands work with us, they get a team who knows that if we don’t rethink everything, we change nothing. What We Do We may be a creative agency but we are most certainly not in the business of advertising. We are in the business of understanding the human psyche. We obsess over the psychology of our audience - what people are into, their pain-points and motivations, what makes them tick – we take all of that and we bring you and your brand to wherever people are – physically, virtually and emotionally.

The Hypotenuse AI platform manages and creates everything from blog articles and product descriptions to social media posts and images within seconds using AI—all in a way that captures a brand’s unique voice. We're reshaping what takes weeks to do, and turning it into days. We move fast. We’ve got over 500,000 users globally, including some of the largest Fortune 500 brands, and are backed by top global investors like Y Combinator, January Capital, and many others. We’ve got an experienced team of A-players with a background in AI research, FAANG, and top start-ups, and are looking for an account executive to join us. The role You’ll be the driving force behind our explosive enterprise growth and strategic partnerships. Your role will be dynamic, continually adapting as our company accelerates. Here’s a breakdown of your core responsibilities: Generate new pipeline through value-driven outreach, while qualifying inbounds and guiding them through our sales process Clearly communicate, discover and demo to key stakeholders, helping them understand and quantify our platform’s use cases in a consultative sales manner Navigate champions through their org's budget, legal, security, and procurement processes. Note that this is often a pioneering sale, where the budget allocation for our solution could be unprecedented. Analyze industry trends and identify potential verticals for growth.

We want people who aren’t just looking for another job but are excited about building something new. We love ex-founders, or people who want to become founders themselves in the future. Here, your rate of growth matters more than where you’re at right now. We look for people who are: Obsessively driven: you’re someone who’s relentless, hungry to learn, and will place personal ambition as one of your biggest priorities right now. Scrappy: you get things done despite limited resources or circumstances going against you. Hands-on: if you’re looking for a job to do “strategy”, or lots of theoretical planning, but not actually get your hands dirty yourself, then we’re likely not a fit.
