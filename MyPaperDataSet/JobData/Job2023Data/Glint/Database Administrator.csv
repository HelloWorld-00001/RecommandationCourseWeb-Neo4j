We're reshaping what takes weeks to do, and turning it into days. Our mission is to power the world's content creation—making it easy, relevant and personal. We’re building the state-of-the-art in machine learning, with an experienced team from FAANG/AI research and top startups, and are backed by top global investors such as Y Combinator. We have global ambitions and are expanding our team in Singapore. If you're looking for a fast-paced start-up with the opportunity to reshape an industry, come join us! Job Description Joining a fast growing start-up isn't like taking a 9 to 5 role in a big company — the impact, learnings and growth here are magnitudes higher, but so is the pace. In this role, you will: Build entirely new features, applications and designs, sometimes from scratch, while also scaling up our existing platforms — our tech stack includes {React, Typescript, Python, FastAPI, AWS...} Thread across frontend and backend, system architecture design, databases, algorithms & data science, and DevOps Balance speed and scale, while keeping in mind the sensibilities to create a high quality user experience Work extremely closely with the founding team and our customers (often cross functionally, and at times putting on a product manager hat) to iterate quickly and build new features. We move quickly and deploy frequently (every few days). We thrive on speed, coupled with a whole lot of new technology—no one comes in with all the answers, and that's ok. But it means that you need to have a constant hunger for learning and growing—very quickly. Here, your rate of growth matters a lot more than your credentials. Requirements We’re looking for people with a constant hunger. People who place learning, growth and impact at the center of their lives. People who obsess over their code; who can't stop thinking about solving challenging problems, and people who just won't give up. Not all these are strict requirements, but experience and a strong foundation will help a long way: At least 4+ years of software engineering experience or equivalent You've designed and built backend architectures (i.e. experience with AWS or GCP, designing APIs, components, databases etc..) You're familiar with software engineering best practices — testing, deployments, agile & sprints, OOP etc.. — and have worked with large codebases before Understanding of algorithms/data structures and computer science fundamentals Experience with web frameworks — both on the client-side (e.g. React, Angular, Vue, ..) and server side (e.g. Flask / FastAPI / Django) Strong written and verbal communication skills High adaptability, strong problem-solving skills and ability to handle ambiguity UX design sensibility and a drive to build great products for users Note: only open to candidates in Singapore or willing to relocate.",Competitive,11-11-2023
