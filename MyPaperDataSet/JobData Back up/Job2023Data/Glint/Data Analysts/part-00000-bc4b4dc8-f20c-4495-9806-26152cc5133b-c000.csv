You're familiar with software engineering best practices — testing, deployments, agile & sprints, OOP etc.. — and have worked with large codebases before Understanding of algorithms/data structures and computer science fundamentals Experience with web frameworks — both on the client-side (e.g. React, Angular, Vue, ..) and server side (e.g. Flask / FastAPI / Django) Strong written and verbal communication skills High adaptability, strong problem-solving skills and ability to handle ambiguity UX design sensibility and a drive to build great products for users Note: only open to candidates in Singapore or willing to relocate.",Senior Software Engineer,Singapore,"Chi tiết công việc Senior Software Engineer tại Hypotenuse AI About Us Hypotenuse AI is an AI content marketing platform that manages and automates content writing for companies, including product descriptions, advertising text, and blog posts.
