Attend recording sessions in-studio (as working conditions allow) and work with voice-over talent, producers, directors and audio support staff to ensure that what's recorded meets our high-quality bar. Work with implementers and audio staff to ensure that new lines are playing accurately in-game. Participate in weekly design meetings and review sessions. Play the game to: analyze and critique current builds for quality and accuracy. Identify areas for added depth and improvements to commentary. Identify opportunities in commentary due to differences in how users PLAY the game of Madden, as compared to a typical NFL game. Requirements: Strong football and NFL knowledge required! Candidate should have deep knowledge of players, teams, recent news, offensive and defensive formations, history, terminology, etc. Creative or sports writing background/experience.
