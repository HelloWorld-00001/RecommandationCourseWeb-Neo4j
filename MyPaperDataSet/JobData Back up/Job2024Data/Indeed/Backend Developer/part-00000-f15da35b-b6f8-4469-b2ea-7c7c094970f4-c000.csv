Postman,"With Postman Live Insights, our vision is to help guide a developer with little previous experience—in both the system being monitored and the Postman API Platform—to productively find and fix issues. Our goal is to be able to help any developer locate API endpoints causing potential issues within 30 minutes of signing up for an account. This will empower even a new developer to find and fix issues in their first days on the job, as easily as they can call an API today. We’ve been working towards the early access launch of Live Insights. Today, the alpha launch focuses on the Live Collections Agent, which passively watches your API traffic to automatically populate a Postman collection with API endpoints. Within just 15 minutes of installing the Live Collections Agent in staging or production, you’ll start seeing endpoints show up in your collection. The Live Collections Agent will keep these endpoints up to date based on new observed traffic. API discovery is just the beginning of what we hope to offer. Coming soon: the ability to explore automatically updated API endpoints based on error, latency, and volume. In the next months, we’re planning to work with our early users to figure out how to surface this information in the most helpful ways. Who Are We? Postman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 25 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500.

Experience working independently. 2+ substantial past projects where they were the sole contributor responsible for delivering large parts of the work. Experience working with 2+ technologies related to this role: K8s, ECS, EC2, eBPF, Docker, or Go performance. Nice To Have: Experience working on a 0-to-1 product. Experience working on developer tools. Experience working on command-line interfaces. Experience with PaaS platforms and infrastructure-as-a-service.

Netflix,"Remote, United States Remote, Canada Remote, Brazil Spry Fox ABOUT OUR TEAM Our motto is, “make the world a better place”; and we try to do this through the games we make. Invention is part of our DNA at Spry Fox. Whether it’s by designing MMOs that encourage the development of friendships and discourage toxicity, or by designing unique puzzle games that promote English language learning; we’re always asking ourselves “how does this game improve your life?” Spry Fox strives to be a studio that is a pleasure to work for, an important but not dominating part of your life, and recognizes crunch is a negative, counter-productive industry practice — something to be learned from and avoided in the future. We want you to have friends, family, hobbies, and a life outside of work. We want you to love your colleagues and know that they support you 100%. We want you to be proud of what you do and how you do it. For 10+ years, we’ve been fully remote with Foxes scattered all over the world. To make that work well, we all try to be online and communicative from 10am to 2pm PST to ensure that we have enough overlapping work hours with our team; otherwise, our schedules are flexible and fully under our individual control!

You will work closely with artists, designers, and other engineers to implement new game features across the server and backend service layers. You will coordinate web service and game server deployments (and scaling) across dozens of machines and hundreds of processes ensuring maximum stability and a smooth player experience. You will be responsible for the security of the studio’s publicly accessible services and game servers. You will be responsible for designing and maintaining the systems that persist data from thousands of requests per second across hundreds of servers. Requirements You are familiar with Python, containerization, container orchestration and SQL databases. You have worked on one or more shipped MMO projects and have a deep understanding of the entire tech stack. You have the ability to communicate with all team members, including artists, programmers, and designers on the many tradeoffs required to build an MMO. Nice To Have You are comfortable with C++ and comfortable implementing and improving gameserver features (like networking and data storage). Our game client uses Unreal Engine, some experience would be a bonus. Our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range.
